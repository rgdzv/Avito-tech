## Avito-tech

>***<p align="justify">Avito-tech is a simple app that fetches images from the server and shows them to the viewer. You can also choose image and see a modal window with commentaries. Pushing commentaries is allowed but they are not saved. This app is a result of the test task from [avito-tech](https://github.com/avito-tech/safedeal-frontend-trainee) to understand the skills of junior front-end developer.</p>***
